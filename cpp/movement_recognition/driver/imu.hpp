 *
 * A 9-DOF IMU built from the two motion chips on the GY-89 board: the L3GD20H
 * gyroscope and the LSM303D accelerometer/magnetometer.  It is named IMU rather
 * than after the board so that swapping in a different sensor only means
 * changing the two member chips below.  (The board's BMP180 barometer has its
 * own driver, bmp180.hpp.)  Exception-free: Begin()/Sample() return bool.
